# Battle Bunny Momo
Home of Momo the Battle Bunny, the (privately hosted) Discord bot. 



**What Momo Can Do**
Use these commands with the command prefix (usually m! but can be reconfigured in .py file
```
Image Commands :
  animemes                Posts a random image from current images in Hot for r/animemes
  memes                   Posts a random image from current images in Hot for r/memes
  wholesomeanimemes       Posts a random image from current images in Hot for r/wholesomeanimemes
  wholesome               Posts a random image from current images in Hot for r/wholesome     


NSFW Functions (stuf that works only in NSFW channels):
  nHentai URL Function    Detects any 6 digit number and creates a nHentai link for it 
  hentai                  Posts a random embedded image from r/Hentai
  hentaigif               Posts a random hentai, but ANIMATED
  rule34 or r34           Posts a random image from r/Rule34
  rule34 gif or r34 g     Posts a random rule34 image, but ANIMATED
  
 (The amount of NSFW commands will eventually outnumber other commands, watch it)
 
Other noteworthy stuff:
  Will probably respond if someone uses the word "bot"


```
    
# Soon To Come
  Will eventually add a function that will remove foul language by sending Furry Porn as a warning.
  Call it an incentive program against foul language if you would.


# Stuff You Need To Do To Run The Bot
```
Because I can't really share my versions of this stuff since I use Momo as well.

In the same directory, create these files:
  channel_id.txt          Must contain the channel ID in which Momo will send a startup message.
  server_key.txt          Contains the Unique Discord Token that is needed for Momo to run.
  reddit_ID.txt           Contains the Reddit Bot's ID
  reddit_secret.txt       Contains the secret key needed for Momo to access Reddit (and also for the code to actually run)
  
Thanks For Reading <3

PS: BurriTaco and WinterAmoeba are the same person, He just had trouble making up his mind about which name to pick
