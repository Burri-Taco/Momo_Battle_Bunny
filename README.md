# What She Can Do

**Reddit Scraper**


***Usage: m!reddit (subreddit)***
  
From a specified subreddit, Momo can embed to the text channel a recently popular post.
  Note: Momo also has a function where she will not post content from NSFW subreddits unless the text channel the
  command was run on is labeled as an "NSFW" Text Channel in the Channel Settings
  
**nHentai Link Embedder**


***Usage: m!doujin (Doujin Code)***

Momo will embed a nHentai link with the specified Doujinshi code. It's a neat feature since the tags are also included in the embed.

***Usage: m!randdoujin***

Feeling Spicy? Momo will generate a random doujin code and embed a link. Kinda like the random button that already exists in the website

   
# Soon To Come

 Better Code
 
 More "Fun" Commands
 
 Spotify/Music Functions
 
Cafe Integration ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

# Stuff You Need To Do To Run The Bot

Because I can't really share my versions of this stuff since I use Momo as well.

In the same directory, create these files:
  channel_id.txt          Must contain the channel ID in which Momo will send a startup message.
  server_key.txt          Contains the Unique Discord Token that is needed for Momo to run.
  reddit_ID.txt           Contains the Reddit token needed to access Reddit Posts
  reddit_secret.txt       Contains the secret key needed for Momo to access Reddit (and also for the code to actually run)
  
Thanks For Reading <3
