# What She Can Do

**Reddit Scraper**


Usage: m!reddit <subreddit>
From a specified subreddit, Momo can embed to the text channel a recently popular post.
  Note: Momo also has a function where she will not post content from NSFW subreddits unless the text channel the
  command was run on is labeled as an "NSFW" Text Channel in the Channel Settings

   
# Soon To Come

  Will eventually add a function that will remove foul language by sending Furry Porn as a warning.
  Call it an incentive program against foul language if you would.


# Stuff You Need To Do To Run The Bot

Because I can't really share my versions of this stuff since I use Momo as well.

In the same directory, create these files:
  channel_id.txt          Must contain the channel ID in which Momo will send a startup message.
  server_key.txt          Contains the Unique Discord Token that is needed for Momo to run.
  reddit_ID.txt           Contains the Reddit Bot's ID
  reddit_secret.txt       Contains the secret key needed for Momo to access Reddit (and also for the code to actually run)
  
Thanks For Reading <3
